Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into  shared repository usually multiple times a day Each merge triggers and automated process to build and test the code, ensuring that new changes integrate smoothly with existing codebase.

why it is needed?
Early detection of errors: By integrating regularly, developers can detect and fix integration issues early, preventing them from escalating into larget problems.
Automatin for Testing: CI Automates the testing process ensuring that code quality remains high and that any bugs are caught early.
Faster development cycles: CI Allows for faster itearation by providing quick feedback to developers leading to more agile and efficient development process
Reduced Integration problems: Regular Integration reduces the complexity and time spent on integrating code into later stages
