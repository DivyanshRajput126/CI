Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into  shared repository usually multiple times a day Each merge triggers and automated process to build and test the code, ensuring that new changes integrate smoothly with existing codebase.

why it is needed?
Early detection of errors: By integrating regularly, developers can detect and fix integration issues early, preventing them from escalating into larget problems.
Automatin for Testing: CI Automates the testing process ensuring that code quality remains high and that any bugs are caught early.
Faster development cycles: CI Allows for faster itearation by providing quick feedback to developers leading to more agile and efficient development process
Reduced Integration problems: Regular Integration reduces the complexity and time spent on integrating code into later stages

How CI Works?
VCS: Developers commit their code to a shared repo.
CI Server: A CI Server monitors the repo. when changes are detected the ci server automatically triggers series of tasks.
Build Automations: The code in built , which includes compiling code and generating artifacts.
Automation Testing:
 - Unit Tests: These checks individual compentes to check they work as expected
 - Integration Tests: These tests verifies that different parts of application works together as needed
 - End to End Tests: These tests simulates the real user scenario to ensure the system as a whole behaves correctly.
Feedback: the result of build and tests are reported to developers in terms of success or failure

Benifits of CI?
Improved Code Quality:Automated testing ensures that codebase remains stable and bug free
Faster Delivery: With Ci, code changes can be deployed more quickly and frequently leanding to faster delivery of new features and fixes.
Collaboration: CI encourages Collaboration among team members by ensuring that everyone code works well together.
Reduced risk: Early detection of issues reduces the risk of larger problems arising later in the development cycle.
